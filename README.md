# RollBot

A dice rolling bot that you needed, but you never knew.

#### Prerequisities:
  - Every bot has a unique key, that you should **NEVER EVER SHARE** with anyone. You have to write yours inside the ``.env`` file that should be located at the root folder. (Right next to ``package.json`` and ``index.js``.) 
    ```
    BOT_KEY=your_bot_key
    ```
    You won't find that file there initially. You have to create it by yourself.
